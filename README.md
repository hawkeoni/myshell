# myshell
A shell I made for a university project.
It did work alright on my other computer, but on the other hand it is kind of broken, due to it not running on my other machine. For some reason function getwd() and a couple of others give a "deprecated function" warning, though most of the features work. This is not a good shell in any way, it is just a reminder of what I did in a couple of sleepless nights. It doesn't have any value, but sentiments. You are free to use it (why would you?) of course.
To recreate the binary simply write $make shell.
